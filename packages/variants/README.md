# [variants](http://dev.office.com/fabric)

Variants are themes based on another theme, subthemes which share the same colors as the original theme, but with those colors used in different places. A variant is still a full theme in and of itself.

This project creates variants of a given theme, which are intended for use with the Customizer component in office-ui-fabric-react. These subthemes allow you to highlight or de-emphasize sections of the page with colors that still match the current theme.

The available variants are:

* Neutral - a soft neutral color is used as the background (light gray in the default theme), most other colors are changed very little or not at all
* Soft - a soft shade of the primary color is used as the background (light blue in the default theme), most other colors are changed very little or not at all, but input controls will look different
* Strong - a strong shade of the primary color is used as the background (blue in the default theme), almost all colors are changed
