# @fluentui/react-flex

**Flexbox abstraction for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

**This is a work in progress therefore this package is unstable**

Abstraction of CSS Flexbox for Fluent UI. Flex allows you to manage the layout, size, alignment, and gap of your components.

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import React Flex components:

```js
import { Components } from '@fluentui/react-flex';
```
