### State

While the scope of the app is small (blueline tool) we are just using React's state management.

If the scope grows, the state management solution may change.

### Take aways

Tree nested vs flat

iframe callback vs messages

### Dropping

- assumes all components can be dropped on all others (allow for config of this)
