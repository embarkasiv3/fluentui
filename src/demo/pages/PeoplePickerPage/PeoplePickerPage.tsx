                The compact variant makes various UI elements smaller, such as the list of results and search button. It should be used in information-dense scenarios that require more compact UI.

              <p>
                The disconnected state includes additional styling and text to let the user know there are issues when performing a search for entities. It should be used if there are connection issues that would prevent a user's search from running.

              <p>
                The Facepile variant adds selected entities to a vertical list below the PeoplePicker's input field instead of directly in the well. It should be used when additional details about the entities may be useful to surface directly, or when the list of entities is meant to be the focus of an experience (such as in a Panel).

              The PeoplePicker is used to select one or more entities, such as people or groups. Entry points for PeoplePickers are typically specialized TextField-like input fields known as a "well", which are used to search for recipients from a list. When a recipient is selected from the list, it is added to the well as a specialized Persona that can be interacted with or removed.
