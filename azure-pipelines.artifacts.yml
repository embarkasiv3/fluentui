# Download and extract build artifacts
steps:
- download: current
  artifact: Build

- task: ExtractFiles@1
  inputs:
    # By default, input patterns start in the root folder of the repo (same as if you had specified $(Build.SourcesDirectory)).
    # It'd be nice to use path variables here, but this task's inputs use relative pathing.
    # Artifacts are downloaded by named directories into $(Pipeline.Workspace) by default, which is one directory up.
    archiveFilePatterns: '../Build/*.tar.gz'
    # Extract into $(Pipeline.Workspace). Archive should include root folder so that contents get extracted into proper subdirectories.
    destinationFolder: '..'
    cleanDestinationFolder: false
