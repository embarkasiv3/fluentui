# Office UI Fabric React 6.0

Welcome to the 6.0 release of Office UI Fabric React. In version 6.0,
*(placeholder: introduce React 16 and Webpack changes))*.

Because we wanted to ..., we've tried to keep the number of breaking changes
to a minimal. *(placeholder: talk about deprecated vars cleanup in a future
release)*.

## Rewritten Command Bar

The CommandBar component is one of the most popular components in Fabric but
has long suffered from bloat and rigidity. The complex resizing logic used to
move surplus items into the overflow menu was customized to the component
making it impossible to reuse, and overriding the styles and functionality of
the menu items was difficult and cumbersome.

Therefore, CommandBar has been completely rewritten from top to bottom using
newer, modular components like OverflowSet, ResizeGroup and CommandBarButton.
This makes it easier to customize and theme with only minor breaking interface
changes.

## Breaking changes
* Moved experimental Command Bar into release.
* Selection utility: getSelectedIndices is now a mandatory member of the `ISelection` interface.
* CommandBar: Interface improvements.
* ContextualMenu: Remove onMenuDismssed from props.
