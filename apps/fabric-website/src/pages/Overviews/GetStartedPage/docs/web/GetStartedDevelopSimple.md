Run this command in the folder where you want to have the project created:

```shell
npm init uifabric
```

It'll prompt you for a project name. For example, if you chose to create a project called `my-app`, you can start working on the project like this:

```shell
cd my-app
npm start
```

Open up the `App.tsx` file and start editing. You'll see your changes in the browser seconds after you hit save.

This scaffold uses the [Just](https://github.com/microsoft/just) build library. It is very flexible and requires no "eject" script to allow customizing configuration.
