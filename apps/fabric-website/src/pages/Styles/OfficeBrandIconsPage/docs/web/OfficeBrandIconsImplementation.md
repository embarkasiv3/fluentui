To use the Office and Office 365 multicolor brand icons, select the format and size that best meets your needs. The following code shows you how to reference the file. Be sure to use the right resolution for the pixel density of the screen youâ€™re targeting.

Office brand icons come in predefined dimensions at 16px, 48px, and 96px. Although you may overwrite icon sizes with your custom styles, we recommend using our icons at the predefined sizes so the images appear as intended. Fabric includes custom media queries that will display our PNG brand icons in a different resolution depending on the device's pixel density. See the code sample below for an example:

```jsx
// Sample code for displaying an Excel 96x96px Icon
<div class="ms-BrandIcon--icon96 ms-BrandIcon--excel" />
```
