Microsoft UI Fabric, formerly known as Office UI Fabric, is the official front-end framework for building experiences that fit seamlessly into a broad range of Microsoft products. As part of the [Fluent Design System](), it enables designers and developers to create coherent experiences across Microsoft and is used by dozens of product teams across the company.â€‹

For designers, it includes toolkits that can be used to create mockups of an experience. For developers, it includes the [Fabric React]() and [Fabric Core]() projects that translate those toolkits into code.
