Consistent representation of people within our experience helps users connect with others effortlessly. Fabric has a couple of controls available to illustrate people accurately and consistently.

An Avatar control displays their profile picture in a circular frame, if one is available; if not, it displays the person's initials or a generic glyph. The Persona includes an Avatar, their name and possibly a few more bits of metadata.

Beside a profile picture, Persona controls can include text elements. The user's full name can show alongside other metadata, such as job title, company, and more.

Persona controls are also available as a performant list view. The 'PersonaList' controls are perfect for listing many people. Examples of this may be an Address Book or a People Picker auto-complete experience.
