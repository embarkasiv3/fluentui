Consistent representation of people within our experience helps users connect with others effortlessly. Fabric has a couple of controls available to illustrate people accurately and consistently.

An Avatar control displays their profile picture in a circular frame, if one is available; if not, it displays the person's initials or a generic glyph. The Persona includes an Avatar, their name and possibly a few more bits of metadata.

The PersonaList view builds upon these controls to show a performant list, like you would see in an address book, or a People Picker auto-complete experience.
