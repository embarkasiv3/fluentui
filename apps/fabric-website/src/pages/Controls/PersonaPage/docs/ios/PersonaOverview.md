Representing users in a consistent manner across different apps helps with effortless communication. Using Fabric Persona controls ensures an accurate and consistent experience across Microsoft products.

Persona controls display the profile picture and online status of the user. When a user does not have a profile picture, the user's initials sit on top of a background color. In the event that both of these options are unavailable, we use a generic icon called a "doughboy."

Besides a profile picture, Persona controls can include text elements. The user's full name can show alongside other metadata, such as job title, company, and more.

Persona controls are also available as a performant list view. The `PersonaList` controls are perfect for listing many people. Examples of this may be an Address Book or a People Picker auto-complete experience.
