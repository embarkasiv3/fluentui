Consistent representation of people within our experience helps users connect with others effortlessly. Fabric has a couple of controls to help with this. An Avatar is their circular profile picture, while the "Persona" includes the avatar, their name and possibly a few more bits of metadata.

The PersonaList view builds upon these controls to show a performant list, like you would see in an address book, or a People Picker auto-complete experience.
