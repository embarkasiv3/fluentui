# Fluent UI RFCs

We're trying a new approach of checking in Fluent UI RFCs to the repo so that they're more persistent, easier to find, and we can use PR comments to discuss the proposals.

## RFC process

### Creation

Start by making a copy of [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) under an appropriate area sub-folder and name. (While we're still experimenting with the RFC process, feel free to create a new area sub-folder if you don't think an appropriate one exists yet.)

Once you're done writing, make a PR and label it with **Type: RFC**.

### Implementation

TBD: Should the RFC file be updated in some way when implementation starts? Should it be deleted when implementation is done, moved to a different location, other?
