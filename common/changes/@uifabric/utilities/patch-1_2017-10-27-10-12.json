      "comment": "This PR addresses #3226 by removing the automatic call to `setPeriodicReset`. Now it is only called when `measure` is called. This prevents unnecessary resets from occurring before measure is even called. Additionally, `reset` no longer calls `setPeriodicReset`, and instead waits again for the next `measure` to set the timeout.",
