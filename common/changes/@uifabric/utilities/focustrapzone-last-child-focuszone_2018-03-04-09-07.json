      "comment": "Focus utility getPreviousElement did not correctly consider the tabbable argument when considering the current node. This can affect how FocusZones are processed, since only one element in a zone will have tab index set. This, in turn, affects how FocusTrapZone traps focus, since getPreviousElement is used during trapping focus.",
