If you refer directly to things like `/lib/utilities/autobind` you will now need to pull them directly from that package, or from the `office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Utilities` top-level import which should continue to work as expected. We are planning to split up more chunks of Fabric into smaller packages that can imported separately, but will also continue to maintain the `office-ui-fabric-react` package and its top-level imports.",
