      "comment": "In order to protect customers that bundle 2 different versions of the same component on the page, we are moving the rules defined by fabric components to CSS modules. This first change only affects the `Toggle` and `Label` components, which have been updated to scope their rules inside of hash-safe class names. No existing class names (`ms-Toggle` for example) have been removed, so any customer customizations should continue to work as expected. This means if you render an old v1 Toggle with a new v2 Toggle compoennt, their class definitions will not conflict.",
